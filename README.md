## End-to-End Data Engineering
The purpose of this repository is to publish open-source content for Data Engineering end-to-end, starting from something like Database bare bones and SQL to modern data-engineering tools on the cloud. The objective is simple, to cover each step of the data-engineering life-cycle one by one in a slow but consistent manner, so that this can become a source of knowledge for other engineers starting their path in this domain.

### Datasets
Data Engineering is everywhere in the sense that in every domain you have some sort of data that is to be stored, processed and analyzed, and you can't do any of these tasks appropiately without cleaning and transforming your data accordingly. For this repository, the focus of the datasets will be on Financial Data since not only it is one of the most common domains where Data Engineering practices are applied on a day-to-day basis, it also has a lot of variety to it which helps in covering up different data modeling and transformation cases.

The datasets will be in most cases manually created ones but based on a real-world scenario so that the essence of industrial use case can be reflected as well.
